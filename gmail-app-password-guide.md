# Gmail App Password Guide

This guide explains how to create and use Google App Passwords for SMTP email sending in the STEM Email platform.

## What is a Google App Password?

A Google App Password is a 16-character code that gives an app or device permission to access your Google Account. App Passwords are needed when:

1. You have 2-Step Verification enabled on your Google Account (recommended)
2. You're using an app that doesn't support Google's modern authentication methods

## Important Characteristics of App Passwords

- Exactly 16 characters long
- No special characters or spaces
- Usually lowercase letters only
- Looks like: `abcdefghijklmnop`
- Generated by Google, not created by you

## How to Generate a Google App Password

1. Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Security** â†’ **2-Step Verification** (sign in if prompted)
3. Scroll to the bottom and click on **App passwords**
4. Under "Select app", choose **Other (Custom name)**
5. Enter a name like "STEM Email" to help you identify this password later
6. Click **Generate**
7. Google will display a 16-character code
8. **Important:** Copy all 16 characters WITHOUT spaces

## Using the App Password in STEM Email

When configuring an email account in the STEM Email platform:

1. Enter your Gmail address (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`)
2. For the password field, paste the 16-character App Password (not your regular Gmail password)
3. Use these SMTP settings:
   - Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - Port: `587`
   - Security: `STARTTLS` (not SSL)

## Troubleshooting Gmail Authentication

If you see an error like "Invalid login" or "Application-specific password required":

1. Verify that 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google Account
2. Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
3. Check that you've copied all 16 characters without spaces
4. Ensure the App Password is still active (not revoked in Google Account settings)
5. Try generating a new App Password

## Security Notes

- App Passwords provide full access to your Gmail account
- You can revoke an App Password at any time in your Google Account settings
- For maximum security, use a unique App Password for each application
- Never share your App Password with others

## Gmail Deliverability Tips

When using Gmail SMTP with STEM Email:

1. Start with low daily sending limits (under 500/day)
2. Gradually increase volume over time
3. Maintain good sending reputation
4. Use proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
5. Keep bounce rates under 2%
6. Monitor email delivery performance regularly
