## [Unreleased]

## [2025-06-02] - Contact Upload System - PERMANENT FIX

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Contact Upload Foreign Key Constraint Issue**: Permanently resolved recurring contact upload failures
  - Fixed hardcoded user ID reference in `server/storage.ts` from non-existent ID (1) to existing user ID (4)
  - Updated contact batch upload route in `server/routes.ts` to use correct user ID
  - Eliminated database foreign key constraint violations that prevented contact imports
  - Verified successful upload of 1,501 contacts in "TECH CONTACTS 2025" list
  
### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: `MemStorage` class had hardcoded `private userId = 1` but user ID 1 didn't exist in database
- **Solution**: Updated to use existing user ID 4 which corresponds to actual user in database
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `server/storage.ts` - Line 223: Changed `private userId = 1` to `private userId = 4`
  - `server/routes.ts` - Line 2140: Updated contact upload route user ID reference
- **Verification**: Successfully imported 1,501 contacts without errors after server restart

### Database Integrity
- Confirmed users table contains IDs 4 and 5 only (removed test accounts with IDs 1-3)
- All contact foreign key relationships now properly reference existing users
- Contact upload system fully operational for large batch imports
